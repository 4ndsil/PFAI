Part A

1. Write down the result of your subjective comparison between minimax
and minimax with alfa-beta pruning. Note, if you have time, you can
actually play the two versions against each other, for a better
comparison.

It was hard to notice any real difference in performance between the regular minmax and minmax with alpha-beta pruning. However, it should perhaps be able to
compute faster since it dosen't have to evaluate every possible action there is. 

2. Write down your thoughts after playing against the AI with the eval function

The eval function improves the AI agent drastically and it always makes its inital moves on the middle of the board, as can be expected from the heuristics 
we've implemented. 

3. Write down your thoughts after playing against the MCTS AI.

Compared to the minmax algortihm the MCTS AI seems to be the better player. However,
it is hard to subjectively measure the effectivness of the different methods. 
As mentioned in the instructions, perhaps a more consistent approach would be to let the versions play eachother 
run a number of interations and statistically calculate the effectiveness based on win:loss ratios from a baseline of say, minimax.
